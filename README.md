# MNIST Digit Recognition API
This repository contains a FastAPI-based web API for recognizing handwritten digits using a pre-trained deep learning model. It provides an HTML form for users to input a digit index from the MNIST dataset, and the API returns the predicted digit along with a plot of the corresponding image.
